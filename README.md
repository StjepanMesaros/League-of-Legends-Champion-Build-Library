# League of Legends Champion Build Library

League of Legends Champion Build Library is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal Heroku. 

Users can choose a champion out of a list of supported ones which will then give them a list of items to use in the game. They can also view what other players have suggested to use and they can even make their own suggestions if they wish to do so.

# How to use

The program will give the user a list of supported champions.

The user will then put in the name of the champion that they wish to see the build for.

Upon receiving the list of items the user will be prompted with an option of viewing the list of items that other players have suggested to use.

If the user has answered yes to that then they will see a list printed in the terminal for them.

If they choose to view it or not either way they will be prompted with another question that will ask them if they want to make their own suggestion.

If they wish to do so then they will be asked to input the name of the champion they want to make a suggestion for and each item separetly.

If they choose not to then the program will say goodbye to them and end the program.
